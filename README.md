This is an exam.
following are the parametres ofthe exam:
I will create a small application with everything I've  learned in the course so far, I will make a very simple JavaScript applicant, also I will need to add in a testing framework and write 3 tests and have them pass.

I will be given 2 pieces of code, these pieces of code wouldnâ€™t be named I'll need to figure out what file they should go into.

I will need to have a project repo and you will need to work in different branches and merge them.

Wish me luck!
